Introduction:
This project showcases a custom PowerShell script designed to automate and manage 
tasks within an Active Directory (AD) environment. The script streamlines common 
administrative tasks such as user creation, group management, and security policy 
enforcement. With this project, Iâ€™ve demonstrated how to efficiently manage a large 
AD infrastructure, minimizing manual effort while maintaining security best practices.
