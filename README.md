- ‚ö° Fun fact: Did you know that the term "firewall" originally comes from construction? It was used to describe a wall built to prevent the spread of fire between buildings or compartments. In cybersecurity, a firewall serves a similar purpose, acting as a barrier to block unauthorized access while allowing legitimate traffic to pass through, just like its namesake in construction!
